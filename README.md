# mobs_war
# by Dokimi
A Minetest mod for use with mobs_redo that turns Minestest into a war zone.


Creates a full scale war between friendly and hostile mobs.

Mobs only spawn in territory controlled by their side. Territory markers are set up by the map spawner, and are created by the mobs themselves. Territory markers also form around the player if they possess the defender rifle/machinegun. Territory markers disappate over time, and can be changed into those of the opposing side. This allows territory to be won, lost, or abandoned by both sides. Control shows up on the minimap: blue is friendly territory, red is hostile.

Fighting will continue until either one side wins, or both are annihilated.

Be warned: these mobs are highly destructive, and lifespans on the front line can be short.


# Mob Types:

Basic riflemen - fire somewhat slowly. Are most common.

Machine gunners - Rapid fire.

Bazookas - slow firing explosives.

Flamethrowers - flames... thrown.

Suicide bombers - rush the enemy and detonate in a massive explosion. (hostile only)

Sniper - high powered slow shooter. (friendly only)

Engineers - place landmines, drone launchers, and autocannons.

Vehicles - machinegun armed utes.

Helicopters - machinegun armed choppers.

Tank - strong, fires explosives.

Autocannons - extremely resilient machinegun emplacements. Friendly ones can be picked up by hand, allowing them to be used for base building.

Drone launchers - spawn drones which act as guided bombs. Friendly drones can be picked up. Of mobs, apart from lucky explosions, only engineers can disable enemy launchers.



The mod also includes weapons for the player based on these mobs. They use varying amounts of gunpowder/tnt as ammo.


Right clicking friendly mobs with weapons or ammo will put them under your command. Right-clicking controlled troops with a torch orders them to follow, if you have weapons or ammo equipped, clicking with anything else orders them to stay.
